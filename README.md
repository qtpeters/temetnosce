An app to help me know myself - and maybe some interesting D3 as well.

What to do? OK, some ideas:

	1. The main screen can be designed with two parts:
		a. The numerically weighted positive attributes ( Virtue ) on the left:
			* Running
			* Spending time with kids
			* Doing tasks for mom...
		b. The numerically weighted negative attributes ( Vice ) on the right:
			* Drinking
			* Smoking
			* Eating poorly
		c. Main screen can be a grid, showing:
			* Title
			* Points
		d. Need controls to add virtue/vice to today's lists
	2. Need screen to create a new Virtue/Vice. Has:
		a. Title, which will be shown on main screen.
		b. Description. ( maybe )
		c. Points ( weight )
		d. Button to add
		e. Button to cancel
